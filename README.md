# System Dynamic Model for NEWgenerator<sup>TM</sup>

## Overview
This repository hosts the R code for the development of a comprehensive system dynamic model tailored for an onsite wastewater treatment system named NEWgenerator<sup>TM</sup> (NG). The core objective of this project is to simulate and analyze the dynamics of water balance and nitrogen adsorption, specifically focusing on the adsorption of ammonium by zeolite. Moreover, the project involves the meticulous calibration of these models using real field trial data to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Project Components
### Water Balance Model
The water balance model, developed with meticulous attention to detail, quantitatively assesses the distribution and flow of water within the NG. It is specifically tailored to ensure minimum specifications are met, providing a foundational understanding of the system's hydrological processes.

### Nitrogen Adsorption Model
This component of the project focuses on the adsorption of ammonium by zeoliteâ€”a critical process for maintaining the system's efficiency and environmental compliance. The model is calibrated to reflect the adsorption dynamics accurately, based on the physicochemical properties of the materials involved.

### Calibration Using Real Field Trial Data
The models have been rigorously calibrated using real field data collected from operational trials of the NG. This calibration process ensures that the models accurately represent the system's behavior under various conditions, thereby enhancing their predictive reliability and validity.
